# Challenge-4

This challenge was to develop an easy quiz app to test our js skills. Building on our foundational understandings learned so far in the bootcamp, this quiz is a few simple questions with highlighted button choices and a response on whether or not the answer provided is correct or not. In addition, this quiz has a 30 second timer.
